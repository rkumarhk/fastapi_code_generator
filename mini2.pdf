Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Employee Management System
1. Introduction
This document provides the requirements specification for the Employee Management System (EMS). The EMS is designed to manage employee data, including personal details, job information, and performance records.
2. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of the EMS backend using FastAPI. This includes functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and system constraints.
3. Scope
The EMS will provide functionalities for:

Employee registration
Employee information management
Job role assignment
Performance tracking
Authentication and authorization

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Employee Registration

FR1.1: The system shall allow administrators to register new employees.
FR1.2: The system shall capture the following employee details:

Full Name
Date of Birth
Contact Information
Address
Job Title
Department
Date of Joining



4.2 Employee Information Management

FR2.1: The system shall allow administrators to update employee information.
FR2.2: The system shall allow administrators to delete employee records.
FR2.3: The system shall allow employees to view their own information.

4.3 Job Role Assignment

FR3.1: The system shall allow administrators to assign job roles to employees.
FR3.2: The system shall allow administrators to update job roles.

4.4 Performance Tracking

FR4.1: The system shall allow administrators to record employee performance metrics.
FR4.2: The system shall allow employees to view their performance records.

4.5 Authentication and Authorization

FR5.1: The system shall provide secure login functionality for administrators and employees.
FR5.2: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC).

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance

NFR1.1: The system shall handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
NFR1.2: The system shall respond to user requests within 2 seconds.

5.2 Security

NFR2.1: The system shall use HTTPS for all communications.
NFR2.2: The system shall encrypt sensitive data in the database.

5.3 Usability

NFR3.1: The system shall provide a user-friendly API documentation using Swagger.

5.4 Maintainability

NFR4.1: The system shall be developed using modular code to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.

6. System Constraints

SC1: The system shall be developed using FastAPI.
SC2: The system shall use PostgreSQL as the database.
SC3: The system shall be deployed on AWS.

7. API Endpoints
7.1 Employee Endpoints

POST /employees: Register a new employee.
GET /employees/{employee_id}: Get employee details.
PUT /employees/{employee_id}: Update employee details.
DELETE /employees/{employee_id}: Delete an employee.

7.2 Job Role Endpoints

POST /job_roles: Assign a job role to an employee.
PUT /job_roles/{employee_id}: Update job role of an employee.

7.3 Performance Endpoints

POST /performance: Record performance metrics.
GET /performance/{employee_id}: Get performance records.

7.4 Authentication Endpoints

POST /auth/login: User login.
POST /auth/logout: User logout.
